// Redux asks the application developer to think carefully about state
// this has a lot of benefits - not least of which is testability (the store is pure function)

// More details on Redux can be found here https://redux.js.org/

// The Bot Framework contains helper code for dealing with conversation Activities
// but for the benefit of the curious, here is some raw implementation...
